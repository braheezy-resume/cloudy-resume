# My Cloudy Resume
My automated cloud-hosted approach to hosting my resume. Implemented this with some twists: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/.

At this point, I can casually make updates to my resume (and any supporting code), push the results to GitHub, and the website at https://resume.braheezy.net will be updated 👍
