## Projects
### [Home Inventory](https://github.com/braheezy/home-inventory-py-env)
Full-stack web application that allows users to store information regarding rooms, items, and their monetary value. A Flask server hosts a REST API, a React client interacts with it, and data is persisted with MongoDB. A separate Terraform project fully deploys the application to AWS, including CI/CD to allow live developer editing of the project.

### [Cloudy Resume](https://braheezy.github.io/posts/2023-05-24-my-cloudy-resume/)
The static website version of this resume that's hosted on AWS. Terraform manages cloud infrastructure and GitHub Actions perform CI/CD operations for supporting repositories. I wrote a Go program, [`resumerk`](https://github.com/braheezy-resume/resumerk), to convert Markdown to HTML and PDF.

### [Violet](https://github.com/braheezy/violet)
A TUI allowing users to see and perform basic operations on installed Vagrant virtual machines. Implemented as a Go wrapper around the Vagrant binary.
